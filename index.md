HabiTile was created by the members of Studio Hungus in collaboration with our community partner, the Minnetrista foundation. This endeavor was undertaken with the goal to create a light tactical game that cultivates curiosity about the local ecosystem. Consisting of a Ball State University collegiate team, the members of Studio Hungus display prowess in game design, programming, art, animation, and music/sound production. The resulting product was created over the course of sixteen weeks and based on a paper prototype designed during the prior semester.

## How to play
---
HabiTile is an up-beat, two player strategy game where one gains or loses points based on where tiles are placed on the board. Each tile, based on an animal within the local ecosystem of Muncie, IN, grants a player different point values based on what tiles are adjacent to it upon placement (including diagonals). The game ends when all spaces on the board have been occupied; at which point, the players' scores are compared. The player with the most points wins!

## System Requirements

The web build of HabiTile is designed to be played on a computer or tablet. While it is possible to run the game on a mobile phone, doing so may result in a lower quality experience.
